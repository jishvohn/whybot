It tastes good to many people because of its sweet and fluffy texture that melts in your mouth. The sugar content in cotton candy also triggers the release of dopamine in the brain, which is a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward. This combination of taste and brain chemistry is what makes cotton candy so delicious to so many people.","children":["gi8flfx"]},"gi8flfx":{"question":"Why?","parent":"0","answer":"Because 😋🍬 is 😍🤤.
